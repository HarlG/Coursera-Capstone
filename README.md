#  Fetal_and_Adult_Gene_Expression

How do we develop from a fetus into a grown human being?

Using RNA-seq data from several age groups, a 2014 study, "Developmental regulation of human cortex transcription and its clinical relevance at base resolution" (Jaffe et al.), aimed to find genes that showed patterns of expression that changed over time as people aged: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4281298/.

Using the primary data from this experiment, data from three fetal samples and three adult samples (aged 36-42) were collected to identify genes that show changed patterns of expression between fetal and adult groups. Next, a histone modification commonly associated with the activation of transcription of nearby genes, H3K4me3, was investigated. The following questions were explored:

1) Are there changes in H3K4me3 between fetal and adult brain over promoters for genes differentially expressed between fetal and adult brain?

2) Are promoters of genes differentially expressed between adult and fetal brain marked by H3K4me3 in liver?

The second question was posited as a control.
